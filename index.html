        <h3>Missile Man</h3>
            <article>Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in
            Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
           specialized in Aeronautical Engineering from Madras Institute of
            Technology. Dr. Kalam made significant contribution as Project
            Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite
             Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully injected the 
             Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and
            made India an exclusive member of Space Club. He was 
            responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly 
            the PSLV configuration. After working for two decades in ISRO 
            and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr. Kalam took up 
            the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at Defence
            Research and Development Organisation as the Chief Executive of
            Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). He was 
            responsible for the development and operationalisation of AGNI
            and PRITHVI Missiles and for building indigenous capability in
            critical technologies through networking of multiple institutions.
            He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister and Secretary, 
            Department of Defence Research & Development from July 1992 to 
            December 1999. During this period he led to the weaponisation of
             strategic missile systems and the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 
             collaboration with Department of Atomic Energy, which made 
             India a nuclear weapon State. He also gave thrust to 
             self-reliance in defence systems by progressing multiple development 
             tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat Aircraft.</article>
